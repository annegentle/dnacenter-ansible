# Ansible Collection - cisco.dnac

## Ansible Modules for DNA Center

The dnacenter-ansible project provides an Ansible collection for managing and automating your Cisco DNA Center environment. It consists of a set of modules and roles for performing tasks related to DNA Center.

This collection has been tested and supports Cisco DNA Center 2.1.1.

*Note: This collection is not compatible with versions of Ansible before v2.8.*

## Requirements
Ansible v2.9 or newer

## Install
Ansible must be installed
```
sudo pip install ansible
```

Install the collection
```
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.dnac
```
## Use
First, define a `hosts.yml` file where you specify your DNA Center servers and their associated credentials:
```
dnac_servers:
  hosts:
    dnac_server:
      dnac_host: 10.10.10.10
      dnac_port: 443
      dnac_username: myuser
      dnac_password: mypass
```

Then, create a playbook `myplaybook.yml` referencing your hosts file and specifying the full namespace path to the module, plugin and/or role:
```
- hosts: dnac_servers
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: Create tag
    cisco.dnac.tag:
      state: present
      description: My Tag
      name: MyNewTag
```

Execute the playbook:
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml myplaybook.yml
```
In the `playbooks` directory you can find more examples and use cases.
